# Zapsi coding rules
## Naming
Software naming is lower case only with underscore.
First name is the name of the software.
Second name is the type.

**Examples**
- zapsi_service
- state_service
- terminal_service
- zapsi_webservice
- terminal_webservice
- lcd_webservice
- zapsi_postgres_database

File naming is lower case one name only.

**Examples**
- config.go
- main.go
- log.go

Variable naming is camelCase, reasonable name should be used. Use runningDevices instead of rd, runDev, ...

##Philosophy
Files should be maximal 1000 lines long, optimal <500 lines long. Comment are forbidden, use logging instead.
Always use main.go as a starting point for every software. Use default go coding conventions. Handle errors first. Do not use if-else, use only if. Use switch instead of multiples if-else.


##Git commits
Commit after every change. Use these tags:
- new
- enhancement
- change
- bug fix

Examples:
- new: table device
- enhancement: added percentage remaining for downloading data 
- change: calculating speed for special speed port (meters to centimeters)
- bug fix: logging was not working properly, not everything was logged
